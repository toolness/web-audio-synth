<h1>Accessible Adventures In Audio Synthesis</h1>

<div class="container">
<p>
  This is my attempt to learn about audio synthesis by generating
  waveforms in the browser.
</p>
<div id="fail">
  <p>
    This experiment uses ES2015 without a transpiler, so it probably
    won't work unless your browser is really awesome.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the time of this writing, that means you need to be using the latest
    version of Chrome, Edge, or Firefox.

<div id="pulse" class="pad">

  <h2>Pulse Wave</h2>
  <p role="status">&nbsp;</p>
  <button>
    Press enter to toggle the pulse wave. Use the left and right arrows
    to control its frequency, and the up and down arrows to control its
    duty cycle.
  </button>

    I thought it would be easiest to start by recreating the beginning of
    my experience, as a listener, of interesting electronic audio.
  </p>
  <p>
    This was the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). It had two pulse
    wave generators, and each could be configured to use one of four
    different duty cycles.
  </p>
  <p>
    Click and drag on the gray waveform pad above to experiment with pulse
    wave synthesis. The x axis controls the frequency of the pulse wave,
    while the y axis controls the duty cycle.

    Note that all pads on this page are built with accessibility in mind.
    Use <kbd>tab</kbd> to focus on a pad and receive instructions on
    keyboard use.

<div id="triangle" class="pad">
  <svg><path d=""/></svg>
  <h2>Triangle Wave</h2>
  <p role="status">&nbsp;</p>
  <button>
    Press enter to toggle the triangle wave. Use the left and right arrows
    to control its frequency.
  </button>
</div>

<div class="container">
  <p>
    The NES had one triangle wave generator, and it came with a number
    of limitations. According to
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=la3coK5pq5w"
     >NES Audio: Brief Explanation of Sound Channels</a>, 
    it was most frequently used for basslines.

<div id="sine" class="pad">
  <svg><path d=""/></svg>
  <h2>Sine Wave</h2>
  <p role="status">&nbsp;</p>
  <button>
    Press enter to toggle the sine wave. Use the left and right arrows
    to control its frequency.
  </button>
</div>

<div class="container">
  <p>
    The sine wave is a
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_tone#Pure_tone"
     >pure tone</a>, which as I understand it, is the fundamental
    building block of more complex sounds. In fact, any periodic
    waveform, including the pulse and triangle waves, can be described as
    a series of these.
  </p>
  <p>
    None of the early audio systems I know of produce plain old sine waves.
    I'm not sure if this is because they're boring, or because pure tones
    were hard to produce back then, or something else.

<div id="noise" class="pad">
  <svg><path d=""/></svg>
  <h2>Noise</h2>
  <p role="status">Just a bunch of random numbers, I guess.</p>
  <button>
    Press enter to toggle the noise.
  </button>
</div>

<div class="container">
  <p>
    I am befuddled by noise.
  </p>
  <p>
    As far as I can tell, noise has no "frequency", it's just a bunch
    of random numbers. And yet the noise generator in the NES
    somehow supported 16 different frequencies.
  </p>
  <p>
    In any case, it looks like noise is mostly used to synthesize
    percussive sounds.
