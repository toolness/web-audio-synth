<h1>Accessible Adventures In Audio Synthesis</h1>

<div class="container">
<p>
  This is my attempt to learn about audio synthesis by generating
  waveforms in the browser.

<div id="fail">

    This experiment requires support for the HTML5 Web Audio API, which
    your browser does not seem to have.

<div id="pulse" class="pad">

  <h2>Pulse Wave</h2>
  <p role="status">&nbsp;</p>
  <button>
    Press enter to toggle the pulse wave. Use the left and right arrows
    to control its frequency, and the up and down arrows to control its
    duty cycle.

    I thought it would be easiest to start by recreating the beginning of
    my experience, as a listener, of interesting electronic audio.
  </p>
  <p>
    This was the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). It had two pulse
    wave generators, and each could be configured to use one of four
    different duty cycles.
  </p>
  <p>
    Click (or touch) and drag on the gray waveform pad above to experiment with pulse
    wave synthesis. The x axis controls the frequency of the pulse wave,
    while the y axis controls the duty cycle.

    Note that all pads on this page are built with accessibility in mind.
    Use <kbd>tab</kbd> to focus on a pad and receive instructions on
    keyboard use.

<div id="triangle" class="pad">

  <h2>Triangle Wave</h2>
  <p role="status">&nbsp;</p>

    Press enter to toggle the triangle wave. Use the left and right arrows
    to control its frequency.

    The NES had one triangle wave generator, and it came with a number
    of limitations. According to
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=la3coK5pq5w"
     >NES Audio: Brief Explanation of Sound Channels</a>, 
    it was most frequently used for basslines.

<div id="sine" class="pad">
  <svg><path d=""/></svg>
  <h2>Sine Wave</h2>
  <p role="status">&nbsp;</p>
  <button>
    Press enter to toggle the sine wave. Use the left and right arrows
    to control its frequency.
  </button>
</div>

<div class="container">
  <p>
    The sine wave is a
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_tone#Pure_tone"
     >pure tone</a>, which as I understand it, is the fundamental
    building block of more complex sounds. In fact, any periodic
    waveform, including the pulse and triangle waves, can be described as
    a series of these.
  </p>
  <p>
    None of the early audio systems I know of produce plain old sine waves.
    I'm not sure if this is because they're boring, or because pure tones
    were hard to produce back then, or something else.

<div id="noise" class="pad">
  <svg><path d=""/></svg>
  <h2>Noise</h2>
  <p role="status">Just a bunch of random numbers, I guess.</p>
  <button>
    Press enter to toggle the noise.
  </button>

<div class="container">
  <p>
    Noise has no intrinsic "frequency", it's just a bunch
    of random numbers. And yet the noise generator in the NES
    somehow supported 16 different frequencies.
  </p>
  <p>
    I think this is because running the noise through a <em>filter</em> can
    be used to effectively remove the higher or lower frequencies from
    the noise.
  </p>
  <p>
    The above pad uses something called a
    <a href="http://www.embedded.com/design/configurable-systems/4025591/Digital-filtering-without-the-pain">FIR filter</a>
    to remove higher frequencies from noise by effectively "blurring"
    the audio samples using averaging. It probably isn't how the NES
    achieved 16 different varieties of noise, but maybe the general
    idea is similar.
  </p>
  <p>
    In any case, it looks like noise is mostly used to synthesize
    percussive sounds.
