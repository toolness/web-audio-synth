This is my attempt to learn about audio synthesis by generating
waveforms in the browser.

Everything here is in the public domain.

## Quick Start

If your browser supports most of ES2015--which at the time of this
writing includes the latest versions of Chrome, Edge, and Firefox--then
you can just open `index.html` in a browser.

Browsers that don't support most of ES2015 will load a transpiled
version of the code. To build the transpiled version, run:

```
npm install
npm run build
```

Then open `index.html` in a browser.
